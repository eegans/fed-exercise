# Front-End Development Assessment 

Figma design example: https://www.figma.com/file/2ceQPELZrsCrGODGgq65FZ/BallerTV-FED-Exercise-About-Us?node-id=0%3A1

## Description
Static site with node-sass complier and nodemon. Uses live-server which I have installed globally. I'd use webpack and other tools but it's a bit overkill.

## Prerequisites
Before you can run this project you need to have a couple things installed first.

1. Install the latest version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
2. Install the latest version of [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm)
3. Install [live-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/live-server) if you want to run it locally using `npm install -g live-server`

## Development server

Run `npm run start` which runs live-server, which is a lightweight dev server which live reloads. Will navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8080/dist/`. 

## Get Started!

1. Go to project folder and install dependencies:

```sh
npm install
```

2. Launch development server which runs live-server--a lightweight dev server which with live reload. Will navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8080/dist/`. :

```sh
npm run start
```

2. Other script which compiles scss:

```
