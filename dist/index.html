                        <h3>Our Vision</h3>
                        <p>BallerTV was founded in 2016 by Cramster co-founders Rob Angarita and Aaron Hawkey to provide
                            live
                            video coverage of amateur sports while creating sports media job opportunities in local
                            communities.
                            As of 2018, BallerTV is now a coast-to-coast operation with a network of thousands of
                            broadcasters
                            across the country. We’re on track to broadcast our 100,000th game this year — and we’re
                            just
                            getting started.</p>
